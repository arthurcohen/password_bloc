# Password BLoC

BLoC study!

Everything started as a simple study with Flutter, trying to learn some more about the framework and this awesome state management pattern called BLoC.

My experience was so good that I decided to make a bigger projetc, with vary examples how to use BLoC, when to use, best practices, and more.

## Getting Started

For now, the project has only one example. The (PasswordBloc)[lib/blocs/password/password_bloc.dart]. There, I use the http library to fetch some data from (passwordrandom.com)[https://www.passwordrandom.com], and list the content dinamicly on the screen.

## Running

Running the app is very simple, you just need to clone this repo, download the dependencies (flutter packages get), and run the project (flutter run)

## Built with

* (Flutter)[https://github.com/flutter/flutter] - Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces

## Author

* (Arthur Cohen)[www.forcohen.com]
